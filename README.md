# TurtleRace
This is a simple turtle race game where turtles of different colors race towards the finish line. The user can guess the winning turtle and see if they make the correct choice.

The Turtle module is used in this project. It is a part of the standard Python library, so no additional installations are required.
You can try the game by checking the python code in main.py. Once you run the file.....
The turtle race window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your guess for the winning turtle.
After making your guess, press enter to start the race.
The turtles will move forward randomly, and the race will continue until one of the turtles reaches the finish line.
Once the race is over, the program will display the winning turtle and inform you if your guess was correct or not.


This project was created as a simple demonstration of the Turtle module in Python. It can be expanded and customized in various ways to create more engaging turtle race games.
